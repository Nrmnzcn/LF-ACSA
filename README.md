# LF-ACSA: Levy Flight–Augmented Artificial Circulatory System Algorithm  

### Definition

LF-ACSA is an improved metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the **human circulatory system** and enhanced by **Levy flight dynamics** to improve global exploration and prevent local stagnation.  

The algorithm was used to:
- Optimize **PID controller parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd)** for **DC motor speed control**,  
- Compare performance against **seven benchmark algorithms** (ACSA, DE, EFO, GA, PSO, SCA, SMA),  
- Evaluate robustness under **load disturbance**, **parameter variation**, and **frequency response** analyses.

This repository contains the **Python source codes**, **flowchart**, and **pseudocode** presented in the paper *“Levy Flight–Augmented Artificial Circulatory System Algorithm (LF-ACSA)”*.  



### Key Features  

- **Bio-Inspired Framework:** Mimics neural–hormonal regulation of the human circulatory system.  
- **Levy Flight Integration:** Heavy-tailed step lengths for enhanced global search.  
- **PID Controller Optimization:** Minimizes the *Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE)* criterion.  
- **Benchmark Validation:** Tested on 23 classical functions and 12 CEC2022 problems.  
- **Robustness:** Verified under multiple DC motor uncertainty scenarios.  
- **Superior Performance:** Achieved lowest ITAE (0.000414) and zero overshoot under nominal conditions.
